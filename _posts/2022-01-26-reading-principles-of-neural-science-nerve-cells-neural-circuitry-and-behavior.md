## The Nervous System Has Two Classes of Cells
There are two main classes of cells in the nervous system: nerve cells, or neurons, and glial cells (神经胶质细胞), or glia.

A typical neuron has four morphologically (形态上) defined regions: (1) the cell body, (2) dendrites 树突, (3) an axon 轴突, and (4) presynaptic terminals 突触前末梢. As we shall see, each region has a distinct role in generating signals and communicating with other nerve cells.

Nerve cells are also classified into three major functional categories: sensory neurons (感觉神经元), motor neurons (运动神经元), and interneurons (中间神经元). Sensory neurons carry information from the body’s peripheral sensors (外围感受器) into the nervous system for the purpose of both perception (感知) and motor coordination. Some primary sensory neurons (初级感觉神经元) are called afferent neurons (传入神经元), and the two terms are used interchangeably. The term afferent (carried toward the central nervous system) applies to all information reaching the central nervous system from the periphery, whether or not this information leads to sensation. The term sensory (感官的) designates (指的是) those afferent neurons (传入神经元) that convey information to the central nervous system from the sensory epithelia (感觉上皮细胞), from joint sensory receptors (关节感觉受体), or from muscle, but the concept has been expanded to include neurons in primary (初级) and secondary (次级) cortical areas (皮质区) that respond to changes in a sensory feature, such as displacement (位移) of an object in space, a shift in sound frequency, or the angular rotation of the head (via vestibular 前庭 organs in the ear) or even something as complex as a face.

The term efferent (传出) applies to all information carried from the central nervous system toward the motor organs, whether or not this information leads to action. Motor neurons (运动神经元) carry commands from the brain or spinal cord to muscles and glands 腺体 (efferent information). The traditional definition of a motor neuron (or motoneuron) is a neuron that excites a muscle, but the designation of motor neuron now includes other neurons that do not innervate (支配) muscle directly but that command action indirectly. A useful characterization of motor and sensory neurons alike is their temporal fidelity (时间保真度) to matters outside the nervous system. Their activity keeps up with changes in external stimuli and dynamical forces exerted by the body musculature (肌肉组织). Sensory neurons (感觉神经元) supply the brain with data, whereas motor neurons convert ideation into praxis (实践). Together they compose our interface with the world.

## Each Nerve Cell Is Part of a Circuit That Mediates (介导) Specific Behaviors
Every behavior is mediated by specific sets of inter-connected neurons, and every neuron’s behavioral function is determined by its connections with other neurons. A simple behavior, the knee-jerk reflex (膝跳反射), will illustrate this. The reflex is initiated when a transient (短暂的) imbalance of the body stretches the quadriceps (股四头肌) extensor muscles (伸肌) of the leg. This stretching elicits (引发) sensory information that is conveyed to motor neurons, which in turn send commands to the extensor muscles to contract so that balance is restored.

Thus, the electrical signals that produce the stretch reflex (牵张反射) carry four kinds of information:
1. Sensory information is conveyed to the central nervous system (the spinal cord) from muscle.
2. Motor commands from the central nervous system are issued to the muscles that carry out the knee jerk.
3. Inhibitory (抑制性) commands are issued to motor neurons that innervate opposing muscles.
4. Information about local neuronal activity related to the knee jerk is sent to higher centers of the central nervous system, permitting the brain to coordinate different behaviors simultaneously or in series.

The stretching of just one muscle, the quadriceps, activates several hundred sensory neurons, each of which makes direct contact with 45 to 50 motor neurons. This pattern of connection, in which one neuron activates many target cells, is called divergence. It is especially common in the input stages of the nervous system; by distributing its signals to many target cells (靶细胞), a single neuron can exert wide and diverse influence. Conversely, a single motor cell in the knee-jerk circuit receives 200 to 450 input contacts from approximately 130 sensory cells. This pattern of connection is called convergence. It is common at the output stages of the nervous system; a target motor cell that receives information from many sensory neurons is able to integrate information from many sources. Each sensory neuron input produces relatively weak excitation, so convergence also ensures that a motor neuron is activated only when a sufficient number of sensory neurons are activated together.

## Highlights
- Nerve cells are the signaling units (信号单元) of the nervous system. The signals are mainly electrical (电信号) within the cell and chemical (化学信号) between cells. Despite variations in size and shape, nerve cells share certain common features. Each has specialized receptors (受体) or transducers (传感器) that receive input from other nerve cells or from the senses (感官) respectively; a mechanism to convert input to electrical signals; a threshold mechanism to generate an all-or-none electrical impulse (电脉冲), the action potential (动作电位), which can be regenerated along the axon (轴突) that connects the nerve cell to its synaptic target 突触目标 (another nerve cell, a muscle, or gland); and the ability to produce the release of a chemical (neurotransmitter 神经递质) that affects the target.
- Neural connections can be modified by experience. In simple circuits, this process is a simple change in the strength of connections between neurons. A working hypothesis (有效假设) in modern neuroscience is that the “plastic (可塑性)” mechanisms at play in simple circuits also play a critical role in the learning of more complex behavior and cognitive function.
