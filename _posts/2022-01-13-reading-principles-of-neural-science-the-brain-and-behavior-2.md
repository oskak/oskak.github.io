## Studies of Language Disorders
The first areas of the cerebral cortex identified as important for cognition were areas concerned with language. These discoveries came from studies of aphasia, a language disorder that most often occurs when certain areas of brain tissue are destroyed by a stroke, the occlusion (闭塞) or rupture (破裂) of a blood vessel (血管) supplying a portion of a cerebral hemisphere.

## Mental Processes
There are several reasons why the evidence for the localization of brain functions, which seems so obvious and compelling (令人信服的) in retrospect (回顾), had been rejected so often in the past. Phrenologists (颅相学家) introduced the idea of localization in an exaggerated form and without adequate evidence. They imagined each region of the cerebral cortex as an independent mental organ dedicated to a complete and distinct aspect of personality, much as the pancreas (胰腺) and the liver (肝) are independent digestive organs.

In the aftermath of Wernicke’s discovery of the modular organization (模块化组织) of language in the brain (interconnected nodes with distinctive functions), we now think that all cognitive abilities result from the interaction of many processing mechanisms distributed in several regions of the brain. That is, particular brain regions are not fully responsible for specific mental faculties but instead are elementary processing units (基本处理单元) that together have a role. Perception (感知), movement, language, thought, and memory are all made possible by the interlinkage (相互联系) of serial and parallel processing in discrete brain regions (computational modules) within these regions. As a result, damage to a single area need not result in the complete loss of a cognitive function (or faculty) as many earlier neurologists believed. Even if a behavior initially disappears, it may partially return as undamaged parts of the brain reorganize their linkages. Further, when focal (局灶的) damage adversely affects a mental function it may do so indirectly by disrupting the function of other principal loci 基因座 (diaschisis).

Modular processing (模块化处理) in the brain was slow to be accepted because, until recently, it was difficult to demonstrate which components of a mental operation were mediated (介导) by a particular pathway or brain region. Nor is it easy to define mental operations in a manner that leads to testable hypotheses (可检验的假设). Nevertheless, with the evolving convergence of modern cognitive psychology and brain science in recent decades, we have begun to appreciate that mental functions can successfully be broken down into subfunctions.

## Highlights (The Brain and Behavior)
- The neuron doctrine (神经元学说) states that individual nerve cells 单个神经细胞 (neurons 神经元) are the elementary building blocks and signaling elements (信号元件) of the nervous system.
- Neurons are organized into circuits with specialized functions. The simplest circuits mediate reflexes; more complex cognitive functions require more sophisticated circuits. This organizational principle (组织原则) extends the neuron doctrine to cellular connectionism (细胞联结主义).

## 基因座
基因座（locus）又称基因位点、位点，是一生物学与遗传算法术语，指某个基因或某个具有调控作用的DNA序列，在染色体上所处的特定位置。

## Diaschisis
Diaschisis is a sudden change of function in a portion of the brain connected to a distant, but damaged, brain area. The site of the originally damaged area and of the diaschisis are connected to each other by neurons.
