## The Brain and Behavior
The ability to sequence (测序) genes and infer (推断) the amino acid sequences (氨基酸序列) of the proteins they encode has revealed unanticipated (出乎意料的) similarities between proteins in the nervous system and those encountered elsewhere in the body.

As a corollary (推论), all the behavioral disorders (行为障碍) that characterize psychiatric illness (以精神疾病为特征) -- disorders of affect and cognition (情感和认知障碍) result from disturbances of brain function (脑功能障碍).

Why is a movement smooth (平稳的) or jerky (生涩的) or made unintentionally in certain neurological disease states (神经系统疾病状态)? Answers to these questions might emerge from looking at the pattern of DNA expression (DNA表达模式) in nerve cells and how this pattern regulates the electrical properties of neurons (调节神经元的电特性). However, we will also require knowledge of neural circuits (神经回路) comprising many neurons in specific brain areas and how the activity of specific circuits in many brain areas is coordinated (协调的).

## The Central Nervous System Has Seven Main Parts
### The spinal cord
The spinal cord (脊髓), the most caudal (尾部) part of the central nervous system (中枢神经系统), receives and processes sensory (感官的) information from the skin, joints, and muscles of the limbs (四肢) and trunk (躯干) and controls movement of the limbs and the trunk. It is subdivided into cervical (颈椎), thoracic (胸椎), lumbar (腰椎), and sacral (骶椎) regions.

The spinal cord continues rostrally (继续延展) as the brain stem, which consists of the medulla oblongata (延髓), pons (脑桥), and midbrain (中脑). The brain stem receives sensory information from the skin and muscles of the head and provides the motor control (运动控制) for the head’s musculature (肌肉组织). It also conveys (传递) information from the spinal cord to the brain and from the brain to the spinal cord, and regulates levels of arousal and awareness (唤醒和意识水平) through the reticular formation (网状结构).

The brain stem contains several collections of cell bodies, the cranial nerve nuclei (颅神经核). Some of these nuclei (核) receive information from the skin and muscles of the head; others control motor output (运动输出) to muscles of the face, neck, and eyes. Still others are specialized to process information from three of the special senses: hearing, balance, and taste.

### The medulla oblongata
The medulla oblongata (延髓), directly rostral (喙部) to the spinal cord, includes several centers responsible for vital autonomic functions (重要的自主神经功能), such as digestion, breathing, and the control of heart rate.

### The pons
The pons (脑桥), rostral to the medulla, conveys information about movement from the cerebral hemispheres (大脑半球) to the cerebellum (小脑).

### The cerebellum
The cerebellum, behind the pons, modulates (调节) the force and range of movement and is involved in the learning of motor skills (运动技能). It is functionally connected to the three main organs of the brain stem: the medulla oblongata, the pons, and the midbrain.

### The midbrain
The midbrain, rostral to the pons, controls many sensory and motor functions, including eye movement and the coordination of visual and auditory reflexes (视觉和听觉反射的协调).

### The diencephalon
The diencephalon (间脑) lies rostral to the midbrain and contains two structures. The thalamus (丘脑) processes most of the information reaching the cerebral cortex (大脑皮层) from the rest of the central nervous system (中枢神经系统). The hypothalamus (下丘脑) regulates autonomic, endocrine, and visceral functions (自主神经、内分泌和内脏功能).

### The cerebrum
The cerebrum comprises two cerebral hemispheres (大脑半球), each consisting of a heavily wrinkled outer layer (the cerebral cortex 大脑皮层) and three deep-lying structures (components of the basal ganglia 基底神经节, the hippocampus 海马体, and amygdaloid nuclei 杏仁核). The basal ganglia, which include the caudate (尾状核), putamen (壳核), and globus pallidus (苍白球), regulate movement execution and motor- and habit-learning, two forms of memory that are referred to as implicit memory (内隐记忆); the hippocampus is critical for storage of memory of people, places, things, and events, a form of memory that is referred to as explicit; and the amygdaloid nuclei coordinate the autonomic and endocrine responses of emotional states, including memory of threats, another form of implicit memory.

Each cerebral hemisphere is divided into four distinct lobes (脑叶): frontal (额叶), parietal (顶叶), occipital (枕叶), and temporal (颞叶). These lobes are associated with distinct functions, although the cortical areas (皮层区域) are all highly inter-connected and can participate in a wide range of brain functions. The occipital lobe receives visual information and is critical for all aspects of vision. Information from the occipital lobe is then processed through two main pathways. The dorsal stream (背侧流), connecting the occipital lobe to the parietal lobe, is concerned with the location and manipulation of objects in visual space. The ventral stream (腹侧流), connecting the occipital lobe to the temporal lobe, is concerned with object identity, including the recognition of individual faces. The temporal lobe is also important for processing auditory information 听觉信息 (and also contains the hippocampus and amygdala buried beneath its surface). The frontal lobes are strongly inter-connected with all cortical areas and are important for higher cognitive processing and motor planning.

Two important regions of cerebral cortex not visible on the surface include the cingulate cortex (扣带皮层) and insular cortex (岛叶皮层). The cingulate cortex lies dorsal to the corpus callosum (胼胝体背侧) and is important for regulation of emotion, pain perception, and cognition. The insular cortex, which lies buried within the overlying frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes, plays an important role in emotion, homeostasis (体内平衡), and taste perception (味觉感知).

## Visual cortex 视觉皮层
左右两个大脑半球各有一部分视觉皮层，左半球的视觉皮层从右视野接收讯息，右半球的视觉皮层从左视野接收讯息。
